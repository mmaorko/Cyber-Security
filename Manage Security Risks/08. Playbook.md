# Playbook
A playbook is a structured guide. It defines what to do, who will do it, and which tools to use in specific situations.

### There are different types of playbooks:

- Incident response playbook
- Security alert playbook
- Team-specific playbook
- Product-specific playbook
Here, we focus on the Incident Response Playbook.

The Incident Response Structure
## 1. Phase One: Triage & Validation (The "Filter")
Before you ring the alarm, you have to know if the threat is real.
- The Goal: Distinguish between a True Positive and a False Positive.
- Action: Pivot from the SIEM alert to the raw logs. Check process trees in your EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) and look for anomalous network spikes.
- Responsibility: Tier 1/2 Analysts.

## 2. Phase Two: Containment & Isolation (The "Stop-Gap")
Once validated, you stop the bleeding.
- Action: Isolate the infected host. In a modern environment, this usually means an "Electronic Isolation" via your EDR tool or moving the VM to a "Quarantine VLAN."
- Strategy: You don't just pull the power plug (which destroys volatile memory/evidence). You sever the network path to prevent lateral movement.
- Responsibility: IR Team / Network Admin.

## 3. Phase Three: Remediation & Recovery (The "Clean Up")
Now you scrub the environment.
- Action: Wipe the infected system and restore from a known-good backup.
- Critical Step: Verify that the backup itself isn't infected. If you restore a backup from 2 hours ago, and the attacker was in the system 4 hours ago, you're just inviting them back in.
- Responsibility: IT Operations / Backup Admin.

## 4. Phase Four: Communication & Reporting (The "Bridge")
This is where many teams fail. You need a clear Reporting Chain.
- Internal: Report to the SOC Manager and CISO immediately if it’s a high-impact event (e.g., PII data at risk).
- External: If legal requirements (like GDPR or HIPAA) are triggered, the Legal/Compliance team must be notified to contact authorities (FBI, etc.).
- Channel: Use a "secure out-of-band" channel (e.g., Signal or an isolated Slack instance) because the attacker might be monitoring your internal email.

## 5. Phase Five: Root Cause Analysis & Post-Mortem (The "Evolution")
A playbook is a Living Document. If you don't update it after an incident, you’re doomed to repeat it.
- The "Why": How did they get in? (Phishing, unpatched VPN, stolen creds?).
- The Update: If the analyst struggled with a specific step, rewrite it. If a tool failed, replace it.
- Responsibility: CISO / Security Architect.

### _The Real Problem: "Action Fatigue"_
The biggest mistake I see is teams focusing on the "clean up" but forgetting the "documentation." If you don't document every command you ran during the heat of the moment, 
you’ll have a nightmare during the Root Cause Analysis (RCA).
### _Business Impact:_ 
A disorganized response leads to extended downtime. Every hour your servers are down because of a "botched restoration" is lost revenue. A clean playbook turns a 24-hour disaster into a 2-hour controlled event.
