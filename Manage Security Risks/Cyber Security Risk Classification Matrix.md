# Cyber security risk level
How you measure the seriousness of a security threat to your organization. It answers two simple questions:

1. How likely is this to happen?
2. If it happens, how bad will it be?
You combine likelihood and impact to decide whether a risk is low, medium, or high.

## Low Risk
This is something that has little impact on the business. Even if it happens, the damage is minor and easy to fix.

#### Examples:
- Defacement of a non-critical public webpage
- Temporary slowdown of a non-essential internal tool
There is no sensitive data involved. Operations continue normally. Financial loss is small or none.

## Medium Risk
This level can disrupt operations or cause noticeable financial or reputational damage.

#### Examples:

- Exposure of internal but non-regulated documents
- Short-term outage of an important internal system
The business feels the impact. It might lose time, money, or trust. But it is not catastrophic.

## High Risk
This is serious. If this risk becomes reality, it can severely damage the organization.

#### Examples:
- Breach of customer PII or financial data
- Ransomware attack on core production systems
- Compromise of regulated data
Here you face legal consequences, heavy financial loss, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. In some cases, business operations can stop completely.

How Risk Levels Are Determined
### You assess risk using:
- Asset value (How critical is the asset?)
- Threat likelihood (How realistic is the attack?)
- Vulnerabilities (How exposed are you?)
- Impact (Financial, operational, legal, reputational)

Many organizations use a risk matrix to score likelihood and impact from 1 to 5. Multiply the numbers. The higher the score, the higher the priority.
What This Means for You
As a security analyst, you do not treat all risks equally. You prioritize high-risk issues first. You document medium risks and plan mitigation. You monitor or accept low risks if the cost of fixing them is higher than the damage they might cause.

Risk management is not about eliminating every threat. It is about making informed decisions and protecting what matters most.
