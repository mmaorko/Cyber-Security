# Open Web Application Security Project(OWASP) Security Principles
OWASP helps developers, security professionals, and organizations understand potential threats and adopt security best practices. OWASP maintains a list of the ten most critical web application security risks, along with effective processes, procedures, and controls to mitigate them.

## 1. Minimize the Attack Surface Area
The goal here is simple: reduce the number of ways a threat actor can get in. An "attack surface" is the sum of all potential vulnerabilities. By disabling unnecessary 
software features or restricting access, you close off the "attack vectors"—like phishing or weak passwords—that hackers use to penetrate defenses.

## 2. Principle of Least Privilege
This means giving users only the specific access they need to do their jobs and nothing more. Here’s the thing: if an entry-level analyst's account is compromised, the 
damage is contained because they don't have the permissions to change system-wide settings. It’s about limitng the "blast radius" of a breach.

## 3. Defense in Depth
Never rely on a single security measure. Defense in depth means layering your controls—like using multi-factor authentication (MFA) alongside firewalls and intrusion 
detection systems. What this really means is that if a hacker breaks through one layer, they are immediately met with another.

## 4. Separation of Duties
This principle prevents fraud and misuse by ensuring no single person has too much power. For example, the person who prepares company paychecks should not be the same 
person authorized to sign them. Splitting these tasks creates a natural system of checks and balances.

## 5. Keep Security Simple
Complexity is the enemy of security. If a system is too complicated, it becomes unmanageable and people start making mistakes or finding workarounds. Keeping your controls 
straightforward makes it easier for teams to collaborate and maintain a high level of protection.

## 6. Fix Security Issues Correctly
When a breach happens, don't just patch the surface. You need to identify the root cause quickly, fix the underlying vulnerability, and then run tests to confirm the repair
actually worked. If the issue was a weak Wi-Fi password, the fix isn't just changing it—it's implementing a stricter password policy.

**_As a security analyst, your effectiveness depends on how well you apply core defensive principles to real-world operations. Beyond the initial basics, there are four additional OWASP principles that are critical for maintaining a resilient security posture._**

### Here is an organized breakdown of these advanced principles:

## 7. Establish Secure Defaults
The most secure state of an application should be its default state. Users shouldn't have to navigate complex settings to become secure; instead, it should require 
extra effort to make the application insecure.

## 8. Fail Securely
If a security control fails or stops working, it must default to the most secure option possible. For example, if a firewall crashes, it should immediately block all 
incoming and outgoing connections rather than staying open and letting everything through.

## 9. Don’t Trust Services
Organizations often work with third-party partners who have different security standards. You cannot explicitly trust that an outsider’s system is secure. What this 
really means is you must verify data. For instance, if a vendor tracks customer reward points for an airline, the airline must verify those balances are accurate 
before sharing them with customers.

## 10. Avoid Security by Obscurity
System security should never rely on keeping technical details hidden. Here’s the thing: hiding your source code doesn't make an app secure. True security relies on 
robust factors like strong password policies, defense in depth, solid network architecture, and fraud controls—not just keeping people in the dark.

### Key Takeaway
Security professionals constantly apply these principles to protect organizations. As an entry-level analyst, using these guidelines helps you promote safe development 
practices and significantly reduces risks for both companies and users.
