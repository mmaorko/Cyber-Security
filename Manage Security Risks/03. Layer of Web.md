# Web Layer
The internet has three main layers. Keep it simple.

## Surface Web
This is what you use every day. You search on Google, scroll Facebook, watch videos on YouTube.
Search engines index these sites. Anyone can access them.
This is only a small part of the whole internet.

## Deep Web
This is much bigger than the surface web.

It includes content that search engines do not index.
#### Examples:
- Your email inbox
- Online banking portals
- Company internal systems
- Private databases

You need login credentials or permission to access these.
Deep Web is not illegal. Most of it is normal and necessary.

## Dark Web
This is a small part of the deep web.

You need special software to access it, like Tor Browser.

- Users hide their identity here.
- Some activity is legal. Some is illegal.

#### In short:
Surface Web = Public
Deep Web = Private
Dark Web = Anonymous network
