A security team’s core mission is to protect an organization’s systems, networks, and data from threats.
### They do this by:

• Monitoring systems for suspicious activity
• Detecting threats such as malware, intrusion attempts, and unauthorized access
• Responding to incidents by containing attacks, isolating affected systems, and remediating issues
• Protecting sensitive data from theft or leakage
• Managing risk by identifying vulnerabilities and reducing exposure
• Implementing security controls like access policies, patching, firewalls, EDR, and SIEM
• Training users to recognize phishing and other social engineering attacks
• Reviewing logs and alerts to understand attacker behavior and system health
