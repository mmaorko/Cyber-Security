# Threat Actor
Threat Actor refers to any individual, group, or automated system that attempts to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (CIA Triad) of a digital environment.
Threat actors can be human (hackers, insiders), organized groups (APT, cybercrime gangs), or automated entities (botnets).

## Modus Operandi and TTPs
Cybersecurity professionals identify threat actors using their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):

### Tactics
What they want to achieve. Example: steal data.

### Techniques
How they do it. Example: SQL Injection, Phishing.

## Procedures
The exact step-by-step methods used during an attack. This structure comes from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
