# Cyber Security Analyst’s Toolkit
The essential tools and methods a security analyst uses for threat detection and incident respon

## SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
A SIEM tool collects and analyzes log data from multiple sources across an organization.
Instead of manually reviewing thousands of log entries, SIEM tools:
- Aggregate data from different systems
- Filter and analyze events
- Detect unusual patterns
- Generate alerts in real time
This allows security teams to respond quickly to potential threats.

### Common SIEM Tools:

#### Splunk Enterprise – 
Splunk Enterprise is a traditional SIEM and log analysis platform that you can run on-prem or in the cloud. It gives you deep control 
over searching, dashboards, and custom detections, which makes it strong for hands-on investigations and real-time monitoring. The tradeoff is that you 
have to manage infrastructure, tuning, and scaling yourself.

**_Splunk Enterprise puts you in control. You manage the platform, build detections, customize dashboards, and handle scaling. It’s powerful but hands-on._**

#### Google Chronicle – 
Google Chronicle is cloud-native and built for massive scale. It focuses on fast ingestion, long-term log retention, and built-in threat intelligence with 
very little operational overhead. You don’t manage servers, and it excels at correlating huge volumes of security data across environments.

**_Google Chronicle removes most of that work. It’s fully cloud-managed, automatically scales, keeps data for a long time, and focuses on fast threat 
detection using Google’s infrastructure._**

The core purpose of any SIEM is to help teams monitor activity, detect incidents early, and reduce organizational risk.


## Playbooks
A playbook is a documented set of procedures that explains how to respond to specific situations.

#### _It outlines:_
- What to do before an incident
- How to respond during an incident
- Steps to take after the incident

Playbooks ensure consistency. They reduce confusion during high-pressure situations and guide analysts through structured response processes. 
They can also apply to compliance reviews, access management, and other operational tasks.

## Network Protocol Analyzer (Packet Sniffer)
A network protocol analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer, captures and examines network traffic.

### _It helps analysts:_
- Inspect data traveling across the network
- Identify suspicious or malicious traffic
- Troubleshoot network-related issues

### Common Tools:

- tcpdump
- Wireshark

These tools allow analysts to see what is happening inside network communications at a deeper technical level.
