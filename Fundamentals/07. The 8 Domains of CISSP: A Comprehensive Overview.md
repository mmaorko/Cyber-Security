# Domain 1: Security and risk Management :
 Foundation of everything. Covers security governance, compliance, ethics, risk assessment, business continuity, disaster recovery, and security policies.
### Short summary: 
Understanding how to manage security at an organizational level. CISSP expects you to think like a security leader, not just a technician.

# Domain 2: Asset security : 
Secure digital and physical asset it also related to the storage maintenance retention and destruction of data
and make sure sensitive info (PII, SPII, PHI) gets proper protection and manages the full lifecycle of data and equipment.
### Short summary:
Identifying, classifying, and protecting information based on its value and sensitivity.

# Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering : 
This domain focuses on the technical optimization of security through the use of effective tools and system design. A primary responsibility here is the practical 
implementation of safeguards, such as configuring firewalls to filter network traffic and maintain organizational productivity.
Covers CIA triad, cryptography, hardware security, secure design principles, and physical security.This is where theory meets real system design.

# Domain 4: Communications and network security: 
This domain centers on securing physical networks and wireless communications to prevent unauthorized exposure. It involves analyzing user behavior—such as stopping employees 
from using unsecured hotspots—and creating strict network policies to keep data transmissions safe.
Securing data in motion and Includes network protocols, firewalls, VPNs, segmentation, wireless security, and attacks like MITM or sniffing.

# Domain 5: Identity and Access Management: 
This domain focuses on ensuring that only the right people have access to specific data and systems. It covers the technical and administrative processes used to identify, authenticate, and authorize users. For a security analyst, this involves managing user permissions and implementing tools like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized entry.

## Key Components of this Domain:
- Penetration Testing: Simulating a real-world attack to find weaknesses before a threat actor does.
- Security Control Testing: Verifying that security measures (like firewalls or encryption) are actually working as intended.
- Vulnerability Assessment: Systematically scanning for known security flaws.
- Auditing: Formally reviewing logs and permissions to ensure compliance and proper access management.

### Short summary: 
Who can access what. Covers authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA), SSO, identity lifecycle, and access control models (RBAC, DAC, MAC).

# Domain 6: Security Assessment and testing : 
The Security Operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative 
measures after a security incident has occurred. This 

### includes using strategies, processes, and tools such as:
- Training and awareness: Educating employees to recognize threats and follow security protocols.
- Reporting and documentation: Keeping clear records of incidents and notifying the necessary stakeholders.
- Intrusion detection and prevention: Monitoring networks for unauthorized access and blocking malicious activity.
- SIEM tools (Security Information and Event Management): Software that aggregates and analyzes log data to identify security threats in real-time.
- Log management: The process of collecting, storing, and reviewing records of system events.
- Incident management: The structured approach used to respond to and manage the aftermath of a security breach.
- Playbooks: Pre-defined, step-by-step guides on how to respond to specific types of security incidents.
- Post-breach forensics: The scientific collection and analysis of digital evidence to determine how a breach happened.
- Reflecting on lessons learned: Reviewing an incident after it is resolved to improve future defenses and processes.

The cybersecurity professionals involved in this domain work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. 
These individuals are trained to handle active attacks, such as large amounts of data being accessed from an organization's internal network 
outside of normal working hours. Once a threat is identified, the team works diligently to keep private data and information safe from threat actors.

### Short summary: 
Verifying that controls actually work.Includes vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, audits, log reviews, and security metrics.

# Domain 7: Security operations:
 This is the "front line" of cybersecurity, focusing on day-to-day activities and incident response. It involves monitoring systems for threats, investigating 
 suspicious activity, and taking action when a breach occurs. It also covers practical maintenance like backups, patching software, and disaster recovery to 
 keep the business running smoothly during a crisis.

# Domain 8: Software development and security : 
This domain addresses integrating security into the software development lifecycle. It includes secure coding practices, application vulnerability management, and testing methods that identify flaws before deployment. You must understand how development methodologies and DevSecOps practices reduce risk. The goal is to build secure applications by design, not repair them after exploitation.
### Short summary: 
Building secure applications and its Covers SDLC, secure coding, code reviews, application vulnerabilities (OWASP), and DevSecOps concepts.
