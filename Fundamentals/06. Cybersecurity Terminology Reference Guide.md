# Core Concepts

## 1. Compliance
The process of following internal policies and external laws or regulations. Compliance helps organizations avoid large fines, legal issues, and security violations.
### What does Compliance do in cybersecurity?
- Makes sure security rules are followed
- Protects customer and company data
- Reduces legal and business risk
- Proves the organization takes security seriously
- Helps pass audits and inspections

## 2. Security Frameworks
Security frameworks are structured guidelines and best practices that help organizations design, implement, and manage their cybersecurity programs. They provide a clear way to protect systems, networks, and data consistently.

### What do Security Frameworks do?
- Define security controls and best practices
- Help identify and manage risks
- Improve overall security posture
- Support compliance and audits
- Guide teams on how to protect digital assets

### Common Security Frameworks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- ISO/IEC 27001
- CIS Critical Security Controls
- COBIT

## 3. Security Controls
Specific safeguards implemented to reduce security risks. These controls are applied based on security frameworks.

### What do Security Controls do?
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Detect security incidents and suspicious activity
- Reduce risk and limit damage
- Protect sensitive data
- Support compliance and audits

### Types of Security Controls
- Preventive: firewalls, access controls, MFA
- Detective: logging, monitoring, IDS/SIEM
- Corrective: incident response, backups, patching

## 4. Security Posture
An organization’s overall ability to protect critical assets and adapt to change. A strong security posture means lower organizational risk.
What shows a security posture?

### How effective the security controls are
- Ability to detect and respond to threats
- How well risks are managed
- Compliance with policies and regulations
- Readiness for security incidents

### Why security posture matters:
- Reduces the risk of cyberattacks
- Helps prevent data breaches
- Protects business operations and reputation
- Shows where security needs improvement


## 5. Threat Actor
Threat Actor refers to any individual, group, or automated system that attempts to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (CIA Triad) of a digital environment.
Threat actors can be human (hackers, insiders), organized groups (APT, cybercrime gangs), or automated entities (botnets).

### Modus Operandi and TTPs
Cybersecurity professionals identify threat actors using their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):

#### Tactics
What they want to achieve. Example: steal data.

#### Techniques
How they do it. Example: SQL Injection, Phishing.

#### Procedures
The exact step-by-step methods used during an attack. This structure comes from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## 6. Network Security
Network security is the practice of protecting an organization’s network and the data moving through it from unauthorized access, attacks, and misuse.

### What does network security do?
- Controls who can access the network
- Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity
- Prevents attacks like hacking, malware, and DDoS
- Protects data as it travels across the network
- Keeps systems available and reliable

### Common network security tools:
- Firewalls
- IDS / IPS
- VPN
- Network monitoring tools
- Segmentation

## 7. Cloud Security
Cloud security is the practice of protecting cloud-based systems, applications, and data from unauthorized access, data leaks, and cyberattacks.

### What does cloud security do?
 
- Controls who can access cloud resources
- Protects data using encryption
- Detects and prevents misconfigurations
- Monitors cloud activity for threats
- Prevents data loss and service downtime

### Common cloud security controls:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Encryption
- Cloud security monitoring
- Security groups / network rules
- Backup and recovery

## 8. Programming  
Programming is the process of writing instructions (code) that tell a computer what to do. These instructions are used to build software, automate tasks, and solve problems.

### What does programming do?

- Creates applications and software
- Automates repetitive tasks
- Processes and analyzes data
- Controls systems and machines
- Helps build security tools and scripts

### Why programming matters in cybersecurity:
- Automates security monitoring and analysis
- Helps write scripts for detection and response
- Supports log analysis and tool development
